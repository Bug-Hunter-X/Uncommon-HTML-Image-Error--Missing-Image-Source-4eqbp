This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML error related to image sources.  The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML page that attempts to display an image using an `img` tag.  However, the specified image source ('nonExistentImage.jpg') does not exist, resulting in a broken image.  The solution (`bugSolution.html`) addresses this by using a placeholder image or checking for the existence of the image before inserting it into the DOM.
